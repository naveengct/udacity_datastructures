problem:
 To find min and max values of an unsorted array.
 
 
Code Design:

 *We are iterating the array in pairs(moving 2 each step).
 *When first value is larger we check with large else with small and update.
 *When second value is larger we check with large else with small and update.
 *By the end of the iteration we return the small and large values.

Efficiency:

 Time Complexity:
  It takes O(n) as we are iterating only once.
  
  
 Space Complexity:
  It only takes two auxilary variables - O(1).
