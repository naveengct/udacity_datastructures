Problem:

 To Rearrange array element to get two numbers who sum is the largest.
 
 
Code Design:
 *We are sorting the given array using the Sorted(merge sort). 
 *We iterate the sorted array in a reverse order. 
 *Add the element alternatively to first and second number till the end.
 *Return the first and second values as integers.
 
 
Efficiency:
 Time Complexity:
  Merge Sort takes O(n log n) time Complexity.
  Then we take O(n) as we iterate through the sorted list.

  Space Complexity:
   Merge sort takes O(n) space and we just use some more auxilaries in calculations.
