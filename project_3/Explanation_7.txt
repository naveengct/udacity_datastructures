Problem:
 To implement HTTPRouter using a Trie.
 
 
Code Design: 
 *First we Define RouteTrieNode with handler variable and children(initially empty).
 *Then we define Router with root, root and error handler. 
 *In add handler function we get the path and split with '/', add each to a Node in the Trie and then set the handler. 
 *In lookup function we get the path and split it with '/', iterate with each Node and return the last iterated node handler. 
 *When there is no such node in the iteration, return error handler.
 
 
Efficiency:
 
 Time Complexity:
   It takes O(n) for a path with n divisions.
   
 Space Complexity:
  It takes O(n) for n sub pages.
